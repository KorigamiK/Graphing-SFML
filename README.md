# Graphing SFML

**Functions** is a graph plotting tool and library written using SFML and
configurable using `cmake`.

The project is located in the `Functions` directory.

## Inspiration

I found [Code Parade's](https://github.com/HackerPoet/) Conics video very
visually pleasing so I decided to have some fun recreating the functions in his videos.

His projects didn't quite run well on my machines so,
I have created the `reference` directory with some of his projects that
use cmake to build the binaries and should be fairly cross-platform.
